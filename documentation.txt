# 📄 AI-Powered Language Learning Chatbot - Documentation

## 📌 Introduction
The AI-Powered Language Learning Chatbot is an interactive web application designed to help users improve their language skills through real-time AI conversations, translations, pronunciation feedback, and mistake tracking. Built using **Streamlit**, it leverages **Groq LLaMA**, **Google Translate**, **gTTS**, and **SQLite** to enhance the user learning experience.

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The chatbot follows a modular architecture with the following key components:

### **1. User Input**
- Users can enter text directly or use speech recognition to provide input.
- If speech input is selected, **SpeechRecognition** converts it into text.

### **2. AI Processing**
- The input is processed by **LangChain** using **Groq LLaMA** to generate an AI-powered response.
- The AI adapts responses based on the user's proficiency level and learning language.

### **3. Translation Layer**
- The AI-generated response is translated into the user’s known language using **Google Translate (Deep Translator API)**.

### **4. Text-to-Speech Output**
- The translated response is converted into speech using **gTTS** and played back to the user.

### **5. Mistake Logging & Correction**
- If the user makes a mistake, it is logged in an **SQLite** database along with AI-corrected responses.
- Users can review their mistakes later for better learning.
